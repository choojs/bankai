The easiest way to compile JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

We want people to have fun building things for the web. There should be no
hurdles between a great idea, and your first prototype. And once you're ready,
it should be easy to package it up and share it online. That's Bankai: a tool
that helps you build for the web. No configuration, and no hassle - that's our
promise.

If this is your first time building something for the web, take a look at
[choojs/create-choo-app](https://github.com/choojs/create-choo-app) to help get
a project setup from scratch :sparkles:.

## ⚠️  HTTPS Instructions
When you first open up your application in a browser, you'll probably see a
warning page about HTTPS connections being untrusted. No worries, this is
entirely expected behavior. Follow the instructions below to solve this for
your browser.

<details>
  <summary>
    <b>How does this work?</b>
  </summary>
  For HTTPS to run on <code>localhost</code>, we must sign a TLS certificate
  locally. This is better known as a "self-signed certificate". Browsers
  actively check for certificates from uknown providers, and warn you (for good
  reason!) In our case, however, it's safe to ignore.

  HTTPS is needed for an increasing amount of APIs to work in the browser. For
  example if you want to test HTTP/2 connections or use parts of the storage
  API, you have no choice but to use an HTTPS connection on localhost. That's
  why we try and make this work as efficiently, and securely as possible.

  We generate a unique certificate for each Bankai installation. This means
  that you'll only need to trust an HTTPS certificate for Bankai once. This
  should be secure from remote attackers, because unless they have successfully
  acquired access to your machine's filesystem, they won't be able to replicate
  the certificate.

## Optimizations
Bankai applies lots of optimizations to projects. Generally you won't need to
care how we do this: it's lots of glue code, and not necessarily pretty. But it
can be useful to know which optimizations we apply. This is a list:

### JavaScript
- __bundle-collapser:__ Remove all pathnames from inside the bundle, and
  replace them with IDs. This not only makes bundles smaller, it prevents
  details from your local dev setup leaking.
- __common-shakeify:__ Remove unused JavaScript code from the bundle. Best
  known as _dead code elimination_ or _tree shaking_.
- __unassertify:__ Remove all `require('assert')` statements from the code.
  Only applied for production builds.
- __uglifyify:__ Minify the bundle.
- __yo-yoify:__ Optimize `choo` HTML code so it run significantly faster in the
  browser.
- __glslify:__ Adds a module system to GLSL shaders.
- __envify:__ Allow environment variables to be used in the bundle. Especially
  useful in combination with minification, which removes unused code paths.
- __brfs:__ Statically inline calls to `fs.readFile()`. Useful to ship assets
  in the browser.
- __split-require:__ Lazy load parts of your application using the
  [`require('split-require')`][split-require] function.
- __babelify:__ Bring the latest browser features to _all_ browsers. See
  [our babel section](#babel) for more details.

### CSS
- __sheetify:__ extract all inline CSS from JavaScript, and include it in
  `bundle.js`.
- __purifyCSS:__ removes unused CSS from the project.
- __cleanCSS:__ minify the bundle.

### HTML
- __inline-critical-css:__ extract all crititical CSS for a page into the
  `<head>` of the document. This means that every page will be able to render
  after the first roundtrip, which makes for super snappy pages.
- __async load scripts:__ loads scripts in the background using the
  [`defer`](https://devdocs.io/html/attributes#defer-attribute) attribute.
- __async load styles:__ loads styles in the background using the
  [`preload`](https://devdocs.io/html/attributes#preload-attribute) attribute.
- __async load styles:__ preloads fonts in the background using the
  [`preload`](https://devdocs.io/html/attributes#preload-attribute) attribute.
- __server render:__ server renders Choo applications. We're welcome to
  supporting other frameworks too. PRs welcome!
- __manifest:__ includes a link to `manifest.json` so the application can be
  installed on mobile.
- __viewport:__ defines the right viewport dimensions to make applications
  accessible for everyone.
- __theme color:__ sets the theme color defined in `manifest.json` so the
  navigator bar on mobile is styled on brand.
- __title:__ sets the right title on a page. Either extracts it from the
  application (choo only, for now) or uses whatever the title is in
  `manifest.json`.
- __live reload:__ during development, we inject a live reload script.

## Configuration
The Bankai CLI doesn't take any flags, other than to manipulate how we log to
the console. Configuring Bankai is done by modifying `package.json`.

Bankai is built on three technologies: [`browserify`][browserify],
[`sheetify`][sheetify], and [`documentify`][documentify]. Because these can be
configured inside `package.json` it means that Bankai itself can be configured
from there too. Also if people ever decide to switch from the command line to
JavaScript, no extra configuration is needed.

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "browserify": {
     "transform": [
       "some-browserify-transform"
     ]
   },
   "sheetify": {
     "transform": [
       "some-sheetify-transform"
     ]
   },
   "documentify": {
     "transform": [
       "some-documentify-transform"
     ]
   }
}
```

## HTTP
Bankai can be hooked up directly to an HTTP server, which is useful when
working on full stack code.
```js
var bankai = require('bankai/http')
var http = require('http')
var path = require('path')

var compiler = bankai(path.join(__dirname, 'example'))
var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  compiler(req, res, function () {
    res.statusCode = 404
    res.end('not found')
  })
})

server.listen(8080, function () {
  console.log('listening on port 8080')
})
```

## Babel
Not all browsers support all of the Web Platform's features. So in order to use
newer features on older browsers, we have to find a solution. The best solution
out there at the moment is Babel.

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a plugin-based JavaScript compiler. It takes
JavaScript in, and outputs JavaScript based for the platforms you've decided to
target. In Bankai we target the last 2 versions of FireFox, Chrome and Edge,
and every other browser that's used by more than 1% of people on earth. This
includes IE11. And if you have different opinions on which browsers to use,
Bankai respects `.babelrc` files.

Some newer JavaScript features require loading an extra library; `async/await`
being the clearest example. To enable this features, the `babel-polyfill`
library needs to be included in your application's root (e.g. `index.js`).

```js
require('babel-polyfill')
```

We don't include this file by default in Bankai, because it has a significant
size overhead. Once Babel includes only the language features you're using,
we'll work to include `babel-polyfill` by default.

## Events
### `compiler.on('error', callback(error))`
Whenever an internal error occurs.

### `compiler.on('change', callback(nodeName, edgeName, state))`
Whenever a change in the internal graph occurs.

## API
### `compiler = bankai(entry, [opts])`
Create a new bankai instance. Takes either an entry file location, or an array
of files.

### `compiler.documents(routename, [opts], done(err, buffer))`
Output an HTML bundle for a route. Routes are determined based on the project's
router. Pass `'/'` to get the default route.

- __opts.state:__ Will be passed the render function for the route, and inlined
  in the `<head>` of the body as `window.initialState`.

### `compiler.scripts(filename, done(err, buffer))`
Pass in a filename and output a JS bundle.

### `compiler.assets(assetName, done(err, buffer))`
Output any other file besides JS, CSS or HTML.

### `compiler.styles(name, done(err, buffer))`
Output a CSS bundle.

### `compiler.manifest(done(err, buffer))`
Output a `manifest.json`.

### `compiler.serviceWorker(done(err, buffer))`
Output a service worker.

### `compiler.close()`
Close all file watchers.
